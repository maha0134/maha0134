## 👋 About Me

I’m a Mobile Developer focused on building **production-ready iOS apps** using **SwiftUI**, **Firebase**, and modern Apple frameworks. I’ve delivered client apps end-to-end, contributed to real-world Flutter and React projects, and enjoy working on products that combine clean UI, scalability, and great user experience.

Currently building multiple **SwiftUI apps** for the App Store and exploring **MapKit**, **HealthKit**, and **WatchOS**.
